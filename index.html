        <p>
          Formally known as <i>Gold Coast</i>, was the first country in sub-sahara Africa to gain independence post-colonialism. It has ranked as Africa's most peaceful country by the Global Peace Index.
          <p>Ghana is a matriachal society regardless of the fact that men still get the power position. This simply means that, where the son will get the position of power,his sisters son would be the next one in line for the throne and not his actual son.</p>

            Ampe, a rhythmic girls' game from Ghana, includes clapping, jumping, dancing, singing activities and a particular fashion style, helping bond communities.
            <br>
            The girls jump and clap their hands at the same time and put forward their legs. If both the leader and the one she picks to begin the game put forward their right leg at the same time then the leader has lost, if she loses for the second and third then she joins the circle and the winner becomes the new leader. But if the leader put forward her right leg and the other put forward her left leg that means the leader has won. Even though 10 pple can play ampe But its been play by two persons at a time. The game is been played by girls but sometimes boys do join because is very interesting and entertaining.

          </figure>

          <p>
            The game of Oware, is very similiar to Ajua, from East Africa. The goal of oware is to capture the greatest amount of seeds as possible. To do so, players make moves in alternate turns until one of them has captured more than 24 seeds. The player who captured more seeds than his opponent when the game ends wins the match. It may also happen that both players have captured the same amount of seeds at the end. In this case, neither player wins the game and the match is said to have ended in a draw.
            <br>
            Each move of the game is done in three phases: collecting, sowing and capturing. During the sowing a player distributes the collected seeds along the board, and during the capture phase the player takes, if possible, the seeds found in the pits of the opponent.

        <!--Third section. Write down a step by step guide on how the game Ampe is played in Ghana.-->
        <h2>How To Play Ampe</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>The game is played with 2 teams, each team consisting of 1 or more players in equal numbers.</li>

          <li>The starting team will elect a leader to start the game.</li>

          <li>A straight landing is where each player has landed with the same foot foward, i.e right foot versus right foot, or left foot versus left foot.</li>

          <li>A bend landing is when the players have landed with opposite foot foward.</li>

          <li>The staring team will win points if the feet land "straight". The opposing team will win a point if the feet land "bend".</li>

          <li>One girl from the first team will begin to jump and clap in synchronicity with a girl of the second team. At the moment the 2 girls land from jumping they will decide to place either their left or right leg forward, hoping to anticipate the other to gain a point.</li>

          <li>If a girl wins a point she moves on to the next girl of the opposing team. This sequence continues until all girls on one team have been beaten. When this happens, the team that won the turn, are given the right to point to a girl on the opposing team to be ejected from the game.</li>

          <li>Once a team has ejected all players of an opposing team, they have succeeded in winning.</li>
